## üîÑ Overview

This guide helps you migrate from the legacy single-department chat widget to the new multi-department system. **Full backward compatibility is maintained** - your existing setup will continue working without any changes.

---

## üìã Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Keep Current Setup (No Changes Needed) ‚úÖ

If you're happy with your current single-department setup, **no action is required**. Your existing configuration will continue to work exactly as before.

**Your current config.yaml**:
```yaml
matrix:
  homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
  access_token: "syt_your_token_here"
  bot_user_id: "@support:your-domain.com"

widget:
  title: "Support Chat"
  brand_color: "#667eea"
  position: "bottom-right"
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Same user experience, same functionality, zero changes needed.

### Scenario 2: Upgrade to Multi-Department ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

If you want to add multiple departments while keeping your existing support setup.

#### Step 1: Backup Current Configuration
```bash
cp config/config.yaml config/config-backup.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Restructure Configuration

**Before (Legacy)**:
```yaml
matrix:
  homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
  access_token: "syt_support_token"
  bot_user_id: "@support:your-domain.com"

widget:
  title: "Support Chat"
  greeting: "Hi! How can we help you today?"
```

**After (Multi-Department)**:
```yaml
# Multi-department configuration
departments:
  - id: "support"
    name: "General Support"
    description: "Technical help and general inquiries"
    icon: "üéß"
    color: "#667eea"
    matrix:
      homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
      access_token: "syt_support_token"
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"  # New: required for guest users
      bot_user_id: "@support:your-domain.com"
    widget:
      greeting: "Hi! How can our support team help you today?"
      placeholder_text: "Describe your technical issue..."

  - id: "sales"
    name: "Sales & Inquiries"
    description: "Product information and pricing"
    icon: "üíº"
    color: "#10b981"
    matrix:
      homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
      access_token: "syt_sales_token"  # Can be same or different token
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
      bot_user_id: "@sales:your-domain.com"  # Different bot for sales
    widget:
      greeting: "Welcome! Ready to learn about our products?"
      placeholder_text: "What product interests you?"

# Legacy fallback (optional - for safety)
matrix:
  homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
  access_token: "syt_support_token"
  admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
  bot_user_id: "@support:your-domain.com"

# Widget appearance
widget:
  title: "Customer Support"
  subtitle: "We're here to help!"
  brand_color: "#667eea"
  position: "bottom-right"
  
  # Department selection configuration
  department_selection:
    title: "How can we help you today?"
    subtitle: "Choose the team that best matches your needs"
    show_descriptions: true
    layout: "grid"
```

#### Step 3: Required New Token

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Multi-department mode requires an **admin access token** for guest user creation.

**Create Admin User**:
```bash
# On your Matrix server
register_new_matrix_user -u admin -p your_admin_password -a
```

**Get Admin Token**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-matrix-server.com/_matrix/client/r0/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "m.login.password",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "your_admin_password"
  }'
```

Add the `access_token` from the response as `admin_access_token` in your config.

#### Step 4: Test Migration
```bash
# Test configuration
npm run serve

# Check for errors
curl http://localhost:3001/api/config
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Users now see department selection before starting chat.

## üîß Advanced Migration Options

### Option A: Gradual Migration

Start with your existing support department, then add new ones:

```yaml
departments:
  # Start with your existing setup as first department
  - id: "support"
    name: "General Support"  # Same experience as before
    matrix:
      homeserver: "https://your-matrix-server.com"
      access_token: "your_existing_token"  # Use your current token
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
      bot_user_id: "@support:your-domain.com"  # Your existing bot
    widget:
      greeting: "Hi! How can we help you today?"  # Same greeting

  # Add new departments when ready
  # - id: "sales"
  #   name: "Sales Team" 
  #   matrix: { ... }
```

### Option B: Different Servers Per Department

Use different Matrix servers for different departments:

```yaml
departments:
  - id: "support"
    matrix:
      homeserver: "https://support.your-company.com"
      access_token: "support_token"
      bot_user_id: "@bot:support.your-company.com"
  
  - id: "sales"  
    matrix:
      homeserver: "https://sales.your-company.com"
      access_token: "sales_token"
      bot_user_id: "@bot:sales.your-company.com"
```

### Option C: Shared vs Individual Room Modes

**Shared Room** (all conversations in one room):
```yaml
matrix:
  support_room_id: "!your_existing_room_id:server.com"
```

**Individual Rooms** (new room per customer):
```yaml
matrix:
  support_room_id: null  # Creates new rooms
```

## üß™ Testing Your Migration

### Test Backward Compatibility
```bash
# 1. Test with legacy config
cp config/config-backup.yaml config/config.yaml
npm run serve
# Visit http://localhost:3001 - should work exactly as before

# 2. Test with new multi-department config
cp config/config-departments.yaml config/config.yaml
npm run serve
# Visit http://localhost:3001 - should show department selection
```

### Test User Experience
1. **New Users**: Should see department selection screen
2. **Returning Users**: Should be restored to their previous department
3. **Legacy Users**: Should still work if you rollback configuration

### Test Matrix Integration
```bash
# Check Matrix connectivity for each department
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPPORT_TOKEN" \
  "https://your-server.com/_matrix/client/r0/account/whoami"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SALES_TOKEN" \
  "https://your-server.com/_matrix/client/r0/account/whoami"
```

---

## üö® Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong, you can instantly rollback:

```bash
# Instant rollback to previous configuration
cp config/config-backup.yaml config/config.yaml
npm run serve
```

Your users will immediately return to the previous single-department experience.

## üîç Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Issue: "Configuration error: Department X: Matrix access token is required"
**Solution**: Add `access_token` or `admin_access_token` to department config

### Issue: "Admin access token required for guest user creation"
**Solution**: Create admin user on Matrix server and add `admin_access_token`

### Issue: Users see old single-department interface
**Solution**: Clear browser localStorage or add `departments` array to config

### Issue: Department selection not showing
**Solution**: Verify `departments` array exists and has at least one department

### Issue: Matrix connection fails for specific department
**Solution**: Test each department's Matrix credentials individually
