# Telegram Integration Implementation Plan
## Private Messaging with Puppeting Support

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Telegram with the Matrix Chat Support Widget using private messaging and puppeting, where support team members log into their own Telegram accounts.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Concept
- **No Group Creation**: Telegram users message the bot privately
- **Puppeting Mode**: Support team logs into their own Telegram accounts via the bridge
- **Direct Conversations**: Private Telegram chats bridge to Matrix rooms in appropriate department spaces
- **Widget-like Flow**: Messages work similarly to the current web widget experience

### Technical Flow
1. Customer messages Telegram bot privately
2. Bot creates Matrix room in appropriate department space
3. Support team member's Telegram account (puppeted via Matrix) joins conversation
4. Messages flow bidirectionally: Telegram ↔ Matrix ↔ Support Team Telegram
5. Conversation appears in Matrix Spaces organization like web widget conversations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Bridge Setup and Configuration ✅
- [x] Docker container configuration for mautrix-telegram
- [x] Bridge configuration with puppeting enabled
- [x] Matrix Spaces integration for Telegram conversations
- [x] Department routing via bot commands
- [x] Private messaging mode (groups/channels disabled)

### Phase 2: Telegram Bot Creation and API Setup
**Tasks:**
1. Create Telegram bot via @BotFather
2. Obtain Telegram API credentials (api_id, api_hash, bot_token)
3. Configure bot commands for department routing:
   - `/start` - Welcome and department selection
   - `/support` - General Support
   - `/tech` - Technical Support  
   - `/verify` - Account Verification
   - `/sales` - Sales & Commerce
4. Set bot privacy settings for private messaging

**Configuration:**
```yaml
telegram:
  api_id: "YOUR_API_ID"
  api_hash: "YOUR_API_HASH"  
  bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```

### Phase 3: Matrix Bridge Integration
**Tasks:**
1. Generate bridge application service registration
2. Configure Synapse with bridge registration
3. Set up bridge database schema
4. Configure puppeting whitelist for support team
5. Test bridge connectivity

**Registration Config:**
```yaml
# /data/synapse/telegram-registration.yaml
id: telegram
hs_token: "auto-generated"
as_token: "auto-generated"
namespaces:
  users:
    - regex: "@telegram_.*:localhost"
      exclusive: true
  aliases:
    - regex: "#telegram_.*:localhost"  
      exclusive: true
```

### Phase 4: Support Team Puppeting Setup
**Tasks:**
1. Support team members create Telegram accounts (if needed)
2. Configure Matrix users for puppeting access:
   - `@support:localhost` → General Support
   - `@tech:localhost` → Tech Support
   - `@verification:localhost` → Account Verification
   - `@commerce:localhost` → Sales & Commerce
3. Bridge login process for each support team member
4. Test puppeting functionality

**Puppeting Process:**
1. Support team member sends `login` to bridge bot in Matrix
2. Bridge provides Telegram phone verification process
3. Support team enters verification code
4. Bridge establishes puppeted Telegram session
5. Support team can now send/receive via their Telegram account through Matrix

### Phase 5: Department Routing and Space Integration
**Tasks:**
1. Enhance SpaceManager for Telegram conversations
2. Implement department detection from bot commands
3. Create automatic room organization in Telegram spaces
4. Configure room naming for Telegram conversations
5. Test space hierarchy with Telegram rooms

**Space Organization:**
```
Customer Support (Root)
├── Telegram (Communication Channel)
│   ├── General Support
│   │   └── @username (Telegram) - General Support #conv123
│   ├── Technical Support  
│   │   └── @username (Telegram) - Tech Support #conv124
│   └── ... other departments
```

### Phase 6: Message Flow Implementation
**Tasks:**
1. Configure message formatting for Telegram ↔ Matrix
2. Implement delivery receipts and read indicators
3. Set up typing notifications
4. Configure message truncation/pagination
5. Test bidirectional message flow

**Message Flow:**
```
Telegram User → Bot → Matrix Room ← Support Team (Matrix)
                                 ↓
                    Support Team Telegram (Puppeted) ← Bridge
```

### Phase 7: Widget UI Integration
**Tasks:**
1. Enable Telegram in spaces configuration
2. Add Telegram identification in room headers
3. Update contact form for social media selection
4. Add Telegram status indicators
5. Test UI compatibility

**Configuration Updates:**
```yaml
# config/spaces.yaml
communicationChannels:
  - id: telegram
    enabled: true  # Enable Telegram channel
    
# Widget UI updates needed in components
```

### Phase 8: Testing and Quality Assurance
**Tasks:**
1. End-to-end testing of complete flow
2. Performance testing with multiple concurrent conversations
3. Error handling and edge case testing
4. Security validation of puppeting setup
5. Integration testing with existing web widget

**Test Scenarios:**
- Customer starts conversation via Telegram bot
- Multiple departments handling different conversations
- Support team switching between Matrix and Telegram interfaces
- Message history persistence and retrieval
- Error recovery and reconnection handling

## Technical Configuration Files

### 1. Docker Compose Update ✅
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Added mautrix-telegram service
mautrix-telegram:
  image: dock.mau.dev/mautrix/telegram:latest
  container_name: mautrix-telegram
  # ... full configuration added
```

### 2. Bridge Configuration ✅
```yaml
# config/mautrix-telegram/config.yaml
bridge:
  puppeting:
    enabled: true
    private_chat:
      enabled: true
    group_chat:
      enabled: false  # Critical: No groups
```

### 3. Spaces Configuration ✅ 
```yaml
# config/spaces.yaml - Enhanced for Telegram
telegram:
  autoCreateDepartmentSpaces: true
  puppeting:
    enabled: true
    messagingMode: "private"
    bridgeMode: "direct"
```

### 4. Matrix Client Updates Needed
```typescript
// src/utils/telegram-bridge.ts - New file needed
// src/components/SocialMediaSelector.tsx - New file needed  
// src/utils/space-manager.ts - Telegram support enhancement
```

## Security Considerations

### Puppeting Security

- Webhook validation if using webhooks instead of polling
- Rate limiting implemented in bridge configuration
- Spam protection enabled

### Privacy
- Customer Telegram usernames/IDs handled with care
- Message content not logged beyond normal Matrix retention
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Clear privacy policy for Telegram integration

## Deployment Steps

### Development Environment
