## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Widget Multi-User Invitation

**Goal**: Verify that widget invites all users from `department_users` array

**Steps**:
1. **Open test page** (already opened):
   - URL: http://localhost:3001/widget/widget-test.html

2. **Click chat button** (bottom-right corner)

3. **Select "General Support"** department

4. **Fill contact form**:
   - Name: `Test User 1`
   - Email: `test1@example.com`
   - Message: `Testing multi-user invitation`

5. **Send message**

6. **Check browser console** (Press F12 → Console tab):
   - Should see: `Invited department user: @support:localhost`
   - Look for invitation logs

7. **Verify in Element**:
   - Open: http://localhost:8081
   - Login as: `support` / `support123`
   - Check for new room: "Test User 1"
   - Room should exist and be accessible

**Expected Result**:
✅ Room created
✅ @support:localhost invited
✅ Message visible in Matrix
✅ No errors in console

---

### Test 2: Multiple Departments

**Steps**:
1. Close widget and reopen
2. Select **"Tech Support"** department
3. Fill form with different details:
   - Name: `Test User 2`
   - Email: `test2@example.com`
   - Message: `Testing tech support`
4. Send message
5. Verify separate room created in Element
6. @tech_support:localhost should be invited

---

### Test 3: Current Limitation Check

**Note**: Since we only have single users per department currently, you'll only see:
- 1 user invited per department
- This proves the code works but with limited users

**To test REAL multi-user (multiple people invited)**:
- Need to run full installation script
- Create 3 departments with 9 total users (3 support, 4 commerce, 2 identification)
- Then rooms will have multiple users invited

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
✅ Widget loads without errors
✅ Department selection shows all 4 departments
✅ Contact form accepts input
✅ Message sends successfully
✅ Room appears in Element immediately
✅ Browser console shows invitation logs
✅ No JavaScript errors in console

### Failure Indicators:

❌ Department selection doesn't appear
❌ Message fails to send
❌ No room created in Matrix
❌ JavaScript errors in console
❌ "User already in room" errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If widget doesn't load:
```bash
# Check server logs
# Server is running in background, check output:
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
```

### If invitation fails:
```bash
# Check Synapse is running
curl http://localhost:8008/health

# Check access token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer syt_c3VwcG9ydA_WuQVgMMyWokphzuvinDp_3qbzPn" \
  http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/r0/account/whoami

# Should return: {"user_id":"@support:localhost"}
```

### If room not visible in Element:
- Refresh Element page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check if logged in as correct user
- Look in "All rooms" section
- Check room list filters
