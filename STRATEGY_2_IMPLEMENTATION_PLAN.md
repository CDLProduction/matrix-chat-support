# Strategy 2 Implementation Plan: Enhanced Room Cleanup

## üéØ Objective
Implement enhanced room cleanup during department switches to prevent Matrix client auto-join interference that causes messages to be routed to wrong rooms.

## üîç Root Cause Summary
- **Issue**: Messages sent to Identification department are routed to Support room
- **Cause**: Matrix client auto-join mechanism overrides `currentRoomId` after department reconnection
- **Solution**: Leave non-current department rooms during switches to prevent background invitations

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### Core Approach
1. **Enhanced Disconnect Logic**: Leave all non-current department rooms before switching
2. **Smart Room Restoration**: Handle re-invitations gracefully when switching back
3. **State Validation**: Add safety checks to prevent room ID corruption

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/utils/matrix-client.ts` - Core Matrix client logic
- `src/components/ChatWidget.tsx` - Department switching UI logic
- `src/utils/chat-storage.ts` - Room storage management

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Enhanced Room Management Logic
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Task 1.1: Add Room Cleanup Methods
- **File**: `src/utils/matrix-client.ts`
- **Description**: Add methods to identify and leave non-current department rooms
- **Details**:
  ```typescript
  // New methods to add:
  private async getAllDepartmentRooms(): Promise<string[]>
  private async leaveDepartmentRooms(excludeDepartmentId?: string): Promise<void>
  private async leaveRoom(roomId: string): Promise<void>
  ```
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Method identifies all rooms user is currently in
  - Method can leave specific rooms while preserving current department room
  - Proper error handling for room leave operations
  - Logging for debugging room operations

#### Task 1.2: Enhance Disconnect Method
- **File**: `src/utils/matrix-client.ts` 
- **Description**: Modify `disconnect()` method to leave non-current department rooms
- **Current Behavior**: Preserves all room memberships
- **New Behavior**: Leaves rooms except current department room
- **Details**:
  ```typescript
  async disconnect(currentDepartmentId?: string): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Leave all department rooms except current one
    if (currentDepartmentId) {
      await this.leaveDepartmentRooms(currentDepartmentId)
    }
    
    // 2. Existing disconnect logic
    this.client.stopClient()
    // ... rest of existing logic
  }
  ```
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Leaves non-current department rooms before stopping client
  - Preserves current department room membership
  - Maintains existing disconnect functionality
  - No breaking changes to existing API

#### Task 1.3: Add Room Re-invitation Handling
- **File**: `src/utils/matrix-client.ts`
- **Description**: Add logic to handle re-invitations when returning to previous departments
- **Details**:
  ```typescript
  private async handleDepartmentRoomAccess(departmentId: string, roomId: string): Promise<boolean>
  private async requestRoomReinvitation(roomId: string, departmentId: string): Promise<void>
  ```
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Detects when user needs re-invitation to department room
  - Requests re-invitation from support bot
  - Graceful fallback if re-invitation fails
  - User-friendly error messages

### Phase 2: Department Switching Integration
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.1 - COMPLETED  
**Task**: Update Department Switch Logic in ChatWidget
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-09-04

**What was implemented**:
1. **Enhanced `handleSwitchDepartment()` function** (line 467):
   - Changed from: `await clientRef.current.disconnect()`
   - Changed to: `await clientRef.current.disconnect(chatState.selectedDepartment?.id)`
   - Added comprehensive logging for Strategy 2 activation

2. **Enhanced `handleStartChatForDepartmentSwitch()` function** (line 531):
   - Changed from: `await clientRef.current.disconnect()`
   - Changed to: `await clientRef.current.disconnect(department.id)`
   - Preserves target department room while cleaning up others

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Strategy 2 Integration**: Department switching now triggers room cleanup automatically
- ‚úÖ **Smart Room Preservation**: Current/target department rooms are preserved during switches
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**: Clear indication when Strategy 2 cleanup is activated
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Other disconnect calls remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**: Widget builds successfully (9.7MB bundle)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Department switching (handleSwitchDepartment):
await clientRef.current.disconnect(chatState.selectedDepartment?.id)

// Department transition (handleStartChatForDepartmentSwitch): 
await clientRef.current.disconnect(department.id)
```

**Workflow Impact**:
When users switch departments, the following now happens automatically:
1. **Save current department room** ‚Üí preserves conversation history
2. **Strategy 2 room cleanup** ‚Üí leaves all non-current department rooms
3. **Clean disconnection** ‚Üí prevents auto-join interference 
4. **Department selection** ‚Üí user can select new department
5. **Smart reconnection** ‚Üí seamlessly connects to new or existing department room

**Strategy 2 Activation Points**:
- User clicks "Switch Department" ‚Üí triggers cleanup preserving current department
- User selects new department ‚Üí triggers cleanup preserving target department
- Matrix client auto-join ‚Üí no longer interferes with department routing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ChatWidget.tsx` - Updated 2 disconnect calls to use Strategy 2

async leaveDepartmentRooms(currentDepartmentId?: string): Promise<void> {
  const allDepartmentRooms = getAllDepartmentRoomIds()
  
  for (const [deptId, roomId] of Object.entries(allDepartmentRooms)) {
    if (deptId !== currentDepartmentId && roomId) {
      try {
        await this.leaveRoom(roomId)
        console.log(`‚úÖ Left ${deptId} room: ${roomId}`)
        clearDepartmentRoomId(deptId) // Clear from storage
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to leave ${deptId} room: ${error}`)
        // Continue with other rooms - don't fail entire operation
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Room Re-invitation Handling
```typescript
// Strategy: Request re-invitation if room access lost
async handleDepartmentRoomAccess(departmentId: string, roomId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const hasAccess = await this.verifyRoomAccess(roomId)
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    console.log(`üîÑ Requesting re-invitation to ${departmentId} room: ${roomId}`)
    await this.requestRoomReinvitation(roomId, departmentId)
    // Wait for invitation and auto-join
    return false // Indicate re-invitation in progress
  }
  
  return true // Has access
}
```

### Auto-Join Enhancement
```typescript
// Strategy: Make auto-join department-aware
this.client.on(RoomEvent.MyMembership, (room, membership, prevMembership) => {
  if (membership === 'invite') {
    this.client!.joinRoom(room.roomId).then(() => {
      // ENHANCED: Only set as current room if it matches expected department
      const expectedDepartmentRoom = this.getExpectedDepartmentRoom()
      
      if (!expectedDepartmentRoom || room.roomId === expectedDepartmentRoom) {
        this.currentRoomId = room.roomId
        console.log('‚úÖ [AUTO_JOIN] Set as current room:', room.roomId)
      } else {
        console.log('üîÑ [AUTO_JOIN] Joined but not setting as current (different department):', room.roomId)

  if (currentDepartmentId) {
    // Strategy 2: Clean up non-current department rooms
    await this.leaveDepartmentRooms(currentDepartmentId)
  } else {
    // Legacy: Preserve all rooms
  }
  // ... existing disconnect logic
}
```

**Files Modified**:

**Code Flow**:
```typescript
// Department reconnection flow:
1. connect(userDetails, departmentId) called
2. ensureRoomAccess(roomId, departmentId) called
3. verifyRoomAccess(roomId) - check if user still has access
4. If no access ‚Üí requestRoomReinvitation(roomId, departmentId)
5. Support bot invites user ‚Üí auto-join handles acceptance
6. Verify access again ‚Üí if success, use room; if fail, create new room
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/matrix-client.ts` - Added 3 new room access management methods
- `src/utils/matrix-client.ts` - Enhanced connect() method integration
- ‚úÖ Widget builds successfully - no breaking changes
