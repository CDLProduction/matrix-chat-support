# Multi-Department Chat Selection - Implementation Plan

## 🚀 **STATUS: PHASE 5 COMPLETED** ✅

**Phase 1: Configuration & Types** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase 2: UI Components** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase 3: Matrix Integration** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase 4: Persistence & History** ✅ COMPLETED
**Phase 5: Testing & Polish** ✅ COMPLETED

The complete multi-department chat selection system is now production-ready! Features comprehensive error handling, department-specific user messaging, configuration validation, graceful fallbacks, integration testing scenarios, and detailed migration guides. Full backward compatibility maintained with zero-downtime migration path.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Transform the current single-channel support chat into a multi-department routing system where users can select their preferred department before initiating a chat conversation.

### Current Flow
```
Chat Button → User Details Form → Matrix Room Creation → Chat Interface
```

### New Flow
```
Chat Button → Department Selection → User Details Form → Department-Specific Matrix Room → Chat Interface
```

## 📋 Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
1. **Department Selection Interface**: User clicks chat bubble and sees department options
2. **Dynamic Department Configuration**: Configurable departments via config.yaml
3. **Department-Specific Routing**: Each department routes to different Matrix rooms/bots
4. **Preserved User Experience**: Same user details form and chat interface post-selection
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Support existing single-department installations

### Department Types (Examples)
- **Support** - General technical support
- **Sales** - Sales inquiries and product information
- **Identification** - Account verification and identity issues
- **Billing** - Payment and subscription issues
- **Technical** - Advanced technical problems

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### 1. Configuration Schema

#### Enhanced `config.yaml` Structure
```yaml
# Multi-department configuration
departments:
  - id: "support"
    name: "General Support"
    description: "Technical help and general inquiries"
    icon: "🎧"
    color: "#667eea"
    matrix:
      access_token: "syt_support_token"
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
      support_room_id: null  # Creates new rooms per conversation
      bot_user_id: "@support:localhost"
    widget:
      greeting: "Hi! How can our support team help you today?"
      placeholder_text: "Describe your technical issue or question..."
  
  - id: "sales"
    name: "Sales & Inquiries"
    description: "Product information and purchasing"
    icon: "💼"
    color: "#10b981"
    matrix:
      access_token: "syt_sales_token"
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
      support_room_id: "!sales-room:localhost"  # Shared sales room
      bot_user_id: "@sales:localhost"
    widget:
      greeting: "Welcome! Ready to learn more about our products?"
      placeholder_text: "What product or service interests you?"
  
  - id: "identification"
    name: "Account Verification"
    description: "Identity verification and account issues"
    icon: "🔒"
    color: "#f59e0b"
    matrix:
      access_token: "syt_identity_token"
      admin_access_token: "syt_admin_token"
      support_room_id: null
      bot_user_id: "@identity:localhost"
    widget:
      greeting: "We'll help you verify your account securely."
      placeholder_text: "Please describe the account issue you're experiencing..."

# Fallback to single department mode if departments not configured
matrix:
  # Legacy single-department config (backward compatibility)
  homeserver: "http://localhost:8008"
  access_token: "syt_default_token"
  # ... rest of legacy config

widget:
  # Global widget settings
  title: "Support Chat"
  position: "bottom-right"
  # Department selection specific
  department_selection:
    title: "How can we help you today?"
    subtitle: "Choose the team that best matches your needs"
    show_descriptions: true
```

### 2. TypeScript Interface Updates

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Component Breakdown

#### DepartmentSelector.tsx
```typescript
interface DepartmentSelectorProps {
  departments: Department[]
  config: DepartmentSelectionConfig
  onSelect: (department: Department) => void
  onClose: () => void
}

const DepartmentSelector: React.FC<DepartmentSelectorProps> = ({
  departments,
  config,
  onSelect,
  onClose
}) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.departmentSelector}>
      <header className={styles.selectorHeader}>
        <h3>{config.title || 'How can we help you today?'}</h3>
        <p>{config.subtitle || 'Choose the team that best matches your needs'}</p>
        <button onClick={onClose} className={styles.closeButton}>×</button>
      </header>
      
      <div className={`${styles.departmentGrid} ${
        config.layout === 'list' ? styles.listLayout : styles.gridLayout
      }`}>
        {departments.map(department => (
          <DepartmentCard 
            key={department.id}
            department={department}
            showDescription={config.showDescriptions}
            onClick={() => onSelect(department)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Enhanced Matrix Client Management
```typescript
class MultiDepartmentMatrixManager {
  private clients: Map<string, MatrixChatClient> = new Map()
  
  async getClientForDepartment(department: Department): Promise<MatrixChatClient> {
    if (!this.clients.has(department.id)) {
      const client = new MatrixChatClient(department.matrix)
      await client.connect()
      this.clients.set(department.id, client)
    }
    return this.clients.get(department.id)!
  }
  
  async createDepartmentRoom(department: Department, userDetails: UserDetails): Promise<string> {
    const client = await this.getClientForDepartment(department)
    return client.createOrJoinSupportRoom(userDetails, {
      roomName: `${department.name} - ${userDetails.name}`,
      roomTopic: `${department.name} support conversation with ${userDetails.name}`
    })
  }
  
  cleanup() {
    this.clients.forEach(client => client.disconnect())
    this.clients.clear()
  }
}
```

### 2. Configuration Validation

#### Server-side Validation
```javascript
function validateDepartmentConfig(departments) {
  const errors = []
  
  if (!departments || !Array.isArray(departments) || departments.length === 0) {
    errors.push('At least one department must be configured')
  }
  
  departments.forEach((dept, index) => {
    if (!dept.id || typeof dept.id !== 'string') {
      errors.push(`Department ${index}: id is required and must be a string`)
    }
    
    if (!dept.name || typeof dept.name !== 'string') {
      errors.push(`Department ${index}: name is required`)
    }
    
    if (!dept.matrix || !dept.matrix.access_token) {
      errors.push(`Department ${dept.id}: Matrix access token is required`)
    }
    
    // Validate Matrix configuration
    try {
      new URL(dept.matrix.homeserver || config.matrix.homeserver)
    } catch {
      errors.push(`Department ${dept.id}: Invalid homeserver URL`)
    }
  })
  
  return errors
}
```

### 3. Database Schema (Future Enhancement)

#### Optional Department Analytics
```sql
-- Future enhancement: Department analytics
CREATE TABLE department_conversations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  department_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  user_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  room_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  resolved_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  satisfaction_rating INTEGER NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_dept_conversations_dept_id ON department_conversations(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_conversations_created ON department_conversations(created_at);
```

## 📞 Technical Requirements Summary

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the Matrix Chat Support Widget from a single-channel system into a flexible multi-department routing platform. The architecture maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for organizations with diverse support needs.

The phased approach ensures manageable development cycles with clear milestones and testing points. Each phase builds upon the previous work, allowing for iterative testing and refinement throughout the development process.

**Estimated Timeline**: 5 weeks for complete implementation
**Development Effort**: ~120-150 hours
**Risk Level**: Medium (well-defined scope with clear fallback strategies)
